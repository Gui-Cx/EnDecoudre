We made this game during the 2022 [GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022), created by Mark Brown of the Youtube channel ["Game Maker's Toolkit"](https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK/featured). We participated as part of Télécom SudParis and Institut Mine-Télécom's game creation club, the CELL.
This game jam started on the 15/07/2022 at 19:00 UTC and finished 2 days later, on the 17/07/2022 at 21:00.

# **Our Game** 

## **Description of the game**

Neon Dice is a two-player cooperation top-down shooter, in which the players play as two dice, whose abilities are determined by their face. They must use these abilities to vanquish the wave of foes coming at them in this synthwave-inspired dungeon. 

The main mechanic of the game is that at any moment, a die can take a "yeet stance", so it can throw the other die in the air when it gets close. When the other die lands, it gets another fully-recharged ability at random.  

This mechanic asks the players to adapt to the abilities they are given, and to co-operate to allow each other to take full advantage of the abilities available.
